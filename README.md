You can download the four .rar compressed files from this repository and extract them on your computer. Once you extract them, you’ll find an executable .exe file. Simply run it, and you’ll have the program ready to use without needing to run or install Python.

In addition, you can download the .py file, which contains the program’s code. You can execute it using Python if you wish.

The .txt files are examples of data for the program. To use your own data, simply create a .txt file where the first column contains the electrode separations, and the second column contains the measured soil resistivities.
