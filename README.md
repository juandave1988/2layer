2 layer soil calculator

You can download the four .rar compressed files from this repository and extract them on your computer. Once you extract them, you’ll find an executable .exe file. Simply run it, and you’ll have the program ready to use without needing to run or install Python.

In addition, you can download the .py file, which contains the program’s code. You can execute it using Python if you wish.

The .txt files are examples of data for the program. To use your own data, simply create a .txt file where the first column contains the electrode separations, and the second column contains the measured soil resistivities.

When you open the program for the first time, press the ‘Reset’ button. 
You can also use the ‘Reset’ button whenever you want to clear your selections. 
It’s not necessary to reset when running an optimization again with a different method. 
Use the ‘Load File’ button to load your measurement data from a .txt file where the first column contains the electrode separations, and the second column contains the measured soil resistivities. 
Next, choose the optimization method. 
If you select the ‘Least Squares’ method, you’ll need to choose a specific submethod for that algorithm. Typically, the ‘Least Squares’ methods yield faster results.
Run Optimization.
